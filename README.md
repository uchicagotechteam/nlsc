# North	Lawndale	Sesquicentennial	Committee

## The	Project
The	following	is	only	a	rough	outline	of	the	project	and	is	subject	to	alterations	in	the	case	that	the	
NLSCâ€™s	needs	change	over	the	course	of	the	project;	ultimately,	the	details	of	the	project	will	be	
coordinated	between	the	NLSC	and	the	project	team	leader.  

TechTeam	would	build	a	website	with  	
* An	upload	portal	that	requires	users	to	fill	out	a	registration	form	with	each	upload	that	
yields	searchable	results.	(An	embedded	Google	Form	would	likely	do.)  
* Historical	and	event	information	to	raise	excitement	for	the	upcoming	sesquicentennial	
celebration.  
* Links	to	social	media.  
* A	means	of	viewing	and	searching	uploads	from	the	upload	portal.  
    * Uploads	should	be	approved	by	the	committee	before	appearing	on	the	website.	(If	a	
Google	Form	is	used	for	the	upload	portal,	Google	Apps	Script	could	possibly	be	
used	to	automate	the	approval	process).  
    * A	searchable	map	with	buttons	to	filter	by	category	(much	like	the	Network	9	
Community	Resource	Directory	at	https://network9crd.github.io)	could	be	one	such	
option	by	which	to	display	links	to	the	video	content,	wherever	that	content	is	
hosted.
